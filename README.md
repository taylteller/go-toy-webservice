# Go Webservice

Trivial webservice example. Generally follows the Pluralsight course "Go: Getting Started." There are various comments throughout that will seem obvious or redundant to a seasoned Go programmer but will help me refresh my memory if/when I try to refamiliarize myself with Go after not using for more than a year.
